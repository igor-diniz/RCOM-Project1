# RCOM FTP Application

This project is a part of the Computer Networks curricular unit @ FEUP.
The idea was to create a communication protocol part of the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model.
For that, an implementation of a serial port protocol was created.
The program used the port to send a file from one computer to another.
A full analysis of the project can be found in the [report (PT)](report.pdf).
